### **2023 Spring** - Sara Dou
### *Assignment 0* - Clone Project



## **Debrief**
The project turned out to be quite challenging, fraught with bugs that required writing extensive redundant code for proper functionality. This situation left me feeling frustrated, as it seemed to stifle my coding skill development. I found myself relying on familiar logic and repeatedly addressing the same issues without making substantive progress. Because I’ve kept fixing some small and pretty dumb bugs, fixing the game feels and adding juice to it causes me to not have enough time to get the actual functionalities done such as enemies moving and respawning. A more flexible schedule for coding assistance sessions would have been beneficial, as my schedule prevented me from attending the existing ones, forcing me to tackle most debugging tasks on my own. While this did marginally improve my debugging skills, having someone that I could ask for help for future projects helps. Planning the structure in advance and understanding the functionalities before delving into the details will be something I will keep on doing. Specifically, employing a state machine has proven invaluable for code organization and simplification, facilitating easier debugging and code readability. Proactive planning, avoiding procrastination, and starting projects earlier will enable me to write cleaner, more accessible code. Additionally, maintaining good commenting practices is essential for collaborative debugging and understanding, an area I admittedly neglected due to time constraints and haste. The player controller code provided was a helpful structural framework for platform protagonist movement, although I didn’t realize that we could use those codes directly at first due to my absences.

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 4

*I think the game feel is okay, I've tried to meet the original gamefeel*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 2


*I didn't quite implement all the things that I've planed to add*


**Overall** - Pass/Fail


*I think overall I did fine*

## **Debrief**
- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?


I played a competitive game with two players. In the game, hungry characters need to eat enough food before starving. Players can move or dash to eat the food. Whoever starves first will lose the game. I like how I show the word hunger through the game's mechanics. There is a bar that shows how hungry you are, and you need to keep it from getting to zero. 

The dash mechanic is also appealing. There’s no cooldown for the dash, and instead, it makes you hungrier, which perfectly suits the game's theme. So, players need to use the dash wisely. Otherwise, it is not helpful and could make the player lose quickly. Also, I like the sprites I chose to use from Itch.io. I select some interesting characters’ sprites and fruits and import them into the game I made. 

I downloaded the pack of sprites from itch.io. Those resources are helpful to me. I like the colorful background and the cute characters in the game. I also built the game's cover on Canva. The cover looks appealing and atheistic. I enjoy creating that art style on Canva. Moreover, I asked AI how to show the bar’s progress through coding. Because this is my first time using the bar to show the condition instead of the number, I’m confused about how it works. So, after talking with AI, I know that I can use the ratio of two values, and in the drawing event, I draw the specific ratio of the bar. These resources are beneficial for my experience of making games.

Next time, I will add some special effects to the character's movement, such as walking, jumping, falling, and dashing. This will make my game more appealing. Also, I will make different kinds of food that have different abilities, such as making the player walk faster during the time or making the player jump higher. I also want to add some skills of each player to make this game more competitive, like throwing some traps to sabotage the rival or shooting the food to destroy them before the rival gets them. What I will repeat next time is I will keep using the bar to show the hunger condition. I think this is a good and straightforward way to show the hunger element in the game. The player will notice their conditions more easily by reading the bar than the number.

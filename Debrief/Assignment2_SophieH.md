## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

The theme I chose for this narrative project is "bubbly". I interpreted it as relating to underwater, so I created and exploration narrative map that is set underwater. Originally I was going to try the baroque theme, but struggled to find 2D game assets, and wasn't sure how to create "baroque" assets myself. Finding underwater assets was pretty fun, and used tilemaps and split all the spritesheets into frames. I did not make any of the assets except for the mermaid. I ended up making an underwater map that the player can explore, and collect pearls to unlock a temple. I added NPCs so the player can click to interact and get clues on how to find the temple and how to unlock it. The inside of the temple is set in another room, which can only be unlocked once player has collected all 5 pearls scattered throughout the map. I wanted to set the narrative as an abandoned underwater city with many ruins, and for the player to talk to NPCs and gain clues. However, I took a while on the dialogue mechanics and didn't end up including as many references to the narrative as I had hoped. There were many other issues I encountered as I worked on this project which I was able to solve relatively easily. I wanted to trigger a sound every time the player went over the bubble object, but struggled to prevent it from playing every frame. So I ended up setting up a timer to stop sounds from overlapping and triggering too frequently. There were a few instances where I tried to trigger audio through code through "Room start" but it didn't work. I chose bubble and water themed sound effects so it matches my bubbly theme. Also, changing the size of the text was more difficult than I expected. I tried the text wrap but the text still was too large for my text box object, and ended up using some text transform or something. It may be less flexible for different resolutions but it ended up working somewhat. If I responsibly allocated more time for this project, I would choose to add more areas to explore and more objectives, as well as expand more on the narrative aspect. Also, I would make a better spritesheet for the mermaid so the movement looks more smooth. 


## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*4 - There were multiple ways of interpreting bubbly but I think my theming is fitting.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*2 - I did not add as many mechanics as I had hoped, and did not allocate enough time for it.*


**Overall** - Pass/Fail


*Pass*

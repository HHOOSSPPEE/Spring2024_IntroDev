## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

I'm happy with the result because it looks really like the original Mario games. The basic functions are all implemented, such as movements, enemies, mushrooms, special tiles, and UI. I’m glad that I figured out how to use Tilemap to set up the whole level and how to bind the tile to the variables. Also, I figured out that putting some objects behind the tiles might be helpful because it is too complicated if I only use Tilemap for some special functions. For the sprite and tiles, I searched for them on Pinterest, downloaded the photo, and cropped it. Sometimes, the size does not fit, so I have to change the resource. Also, I asked AI how to remove the tile when the avatar collides with it. I learned a new function: tilemap_set_at_pixel(), which can set the tile to zero when you input its position and size.

Since this is the first attempt at copying the game, something still needs to be refined. For example, the avatar cannot move backward once the camera moves forward, and Mario's movement still looks awkward. And for the next time, I want to make Mario who can throw a fireball. It seems like making the condition of the mushroom is a little bit hard for me.

I will not bind the tile with variables and manipulate the variables next time. It is not easy to code for every tile and give them functions. Instead, I’ll put the object behind the tiles so that I can code the objects. This is easier. And for the rest, I'll do the same.


## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*Write your elaboration within the asterixis*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*Write your elaboration within the asterixis*


**Overall** - Pass/Fail


*Write your elaboration within the asterixis*

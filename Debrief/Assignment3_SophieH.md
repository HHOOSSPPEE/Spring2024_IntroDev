## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

The theme that I chose for this project is "perseverance". I decided to make a platform game similar to Fireboy and Watergirl, and the "perseverance" aspect of my game is the gameplay of finding gems and working with the other player to overcome obstacles and puzzles(?). The gameplay is very annoying because of the mediocre movement and perseverance is needed to complete the game. I chose a space/cave theme because space travel and cave exploration require perseverance. I found assets on itch.io for the background and terrain online, then made the player, collectible, and monster sprites. The game consists of two player characters and they are moved with separate controls, the WASD and arrow keys. The objective of the game is to collect 6 star collectibles, consisting of 3 different colors, 2 of each colors. They can only be collected when both players are standing next to two collectibles of the same color, in two different locations. This highlights the co-op concept of the game, as there are parts of the game where one player cannot proceed without the other. For example, player 2 has to press a button to let player 1 out of a gate to proceed and collect. I added shooting projectiles so mobs can drop collectibles that are necessary for players to win the game. Players have one shared health of one heart, and will die if they hit any obstacle or bump into an enemy(spiky terrain, blue fire, flower monster, etc). I also allowed for PvP and for players to kill one another because why not, and it's just another way of playing. It's supposed to be a co-op game but because its frustrating, sometimes we want to express our anger to the other player. I like the puzzle aspect of the game, as you do need to think things through to an extent before moving, or else the game can become significantly harder(falling down too far and having to climb back up) Players also have to make sure they don't accidently kill each other if they are cooperating. I added a separate scoring system that tallies points for total monsters killed and collectibles collected, 5 and 10 points each respectively. At first I considered making one character that both players play different controls of, but decided that having two characters allows for more puzzle options. I would like to add more levels in different themes, colors, and additional puzzles and enemies. I would also improve the movement feel, and probably add more health that is displayed as hearts on the screen. 3 hearts per player, and they would respawn at their own spawn, but not respawn the other player. The game would only reset if someone loses all their health. This would also allow for more variety if they choose to fight each other. 

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 4

*Yes, perseverance is pretty broad but I think the gameplay and atmosphere works with the theme.*

*Write your elaboration within the asterixis*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4


*I wish I had planned more for additional levels.*


**Overall** - Pass


*Overall I think I did okay*

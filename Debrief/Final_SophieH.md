## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

I made the questionable yet expected decision of leaving the hardest theme for last, which in my case is "baroque". I ultimately decided to improve the gameplay and implement the theme to my multiplayer parkour game. It was originally themed around "perseverance", which is relatively flexible and I made it a space theme. I went and completely rethemed everything, looked for new assets (there aren't that many 'baroque' themed assets for a 2D pixel game), and had to make some of my own. I found that Pinterest had a lot of cute baroque themed pixel stuff. First I finished up the first level and fixed a few things. There was one major bug where if both players stood at the same collectible, it would still collect both collectibles of the same type. (for example, if both players stood at the same half note collectible, the same collectible type somewhere else on the map would get collected as well.) Some fixes/adjustments I made were the player movement, added a ghost enemy, changed all the sprites and assets, added baroque music(Bach), added two more levels, added a start and end screen with score and directions, fixed the scoring system that did not account for resetting levels/added levels, a level reset button in case players get made a mistake with the puzzle, player sprite animations, and lots of furniture. I changed the collectibles to music notes that glowed when players are close to them. For the new levels, I would first design the path players would have to take to find and collect the collectibles in order to obtain the music script(last thing to collect in a level, unlocked after collecting the 6 music notes) This includes placing the parkour tile set layer and designing it, as well as adding in the enemies and collectibles. Then, I would playtest it and adjust it until it was 1. possible to complete, 2. harder than the previous level, whether in parkour, opportunity for players to make mistakes, or adding enemies in more annoying spots. Then, I would add the wallpaper/background according to the parkour tilemap layer, trying to make it look like rooms of a baroque mansion. Afterwards, I would add the furniture. I enjoyed putting together the new levels. There were numerous coding issues that I ran into, given rooms resetting, scores resetting, global variables having to be reset, etc. No major bugs, just minor ones. The worst was probably when I swapped to different player sprites and added the animation, and they kept getting stuck in blocks even though it was practically the same code as the previous iteration of the game. I eventually figured out that the player collision origin thing was in the wrong spot. I found audios for baroque music on youtube then coverted them to mp3. For sound effects, I got them off of pixabay. If I didn't have other finals(or later), I would add more levels and not only that, but add more types of puzzle mechanics other than gates and levers. 

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*Though it took extensive searching for assets and having to make some assets in Gamemaker, I think the theme fits well. my reference photos for "baroque" showed lots of white and gold gilding + i added music*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*I think I spent a good amount of time on it and added a decent number of things compared to before.*


**Overall** - Pass


*i think i spent a good amount of time on it and made effort to follow the theme + improve my previous game*

**## \*\*Debrief\*\***

Given the initial theme of “down” within a multiplayer game, I decided to create a two player game where they race against each other to reach the bottom. The player to the left is assigned the keys WASD while the player to the right is assigned the arrow keys. Both players are given the same obstacle, starting at the top of the screen. The camera following works by focusing on the center of the player that is closer to the bottom. The winning condition is either beating the player to the bottom or making the player go out of frame. I think that the idea is unique but the execution could have been better. Within the game I incorporated obstacles including trampoline bouncers, portals, and caution slows that complicate the playing field for players. I think that these obstacles add a unique twist to the game instead of purely just jumps. This allows players to use these obstacles to their advantage to gain small leads against their opponents. My initial inspiration for this game was Jump King. Facing the pressure of having to be precise within each jump is mirrored in my game where players have to be precise within their own jumps so they do not fall behind. I like that the players must be careful with each jump and decision that they make try and knock out the other player. One feedback that I received was that I should make a beam that comes from the top and slowly comes down, eliminating any player that is not quick enough instead of having the camera follow the player. While I think this could work, I think that this works better for a game where players must climb upwards. From my initial version of the game I attempted to fix a lot of the physics that experienced a lot of bugs. While this newer version is improved, I wish to create a more fluid movement for players. Something that I wish to improve in my next edition to my game is slowly introducing each obstacle within the platformer. Because I do not have a tutorial section, players may feel overwhelmed when being first placed in the game. Also, when a player wins, I should stop all action that happens within the game. When the playtesters finished the game, it was not transparent enough to the players that a player had already won the game.

**## \*\*Self Evaluation\*\***

**\*\*Execution\*\*** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 4

*I think that I worked with the theme “down” pretty well while falling under the restriction of a multiplayer game. My second theme of “travel” is used through the portals where players travel from place to place to give themselves an advantage, or a resetting mechanism.*

**\*\*Scope\*\*** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4

*I think that the idea for the game is pretty good. I think that something that I could have improved on is making it a better playing experience for players by making it more clear what is happening within the game either through what each obstacle does or when the game is finished.*

**\*\*Overall\*\*** - Pass

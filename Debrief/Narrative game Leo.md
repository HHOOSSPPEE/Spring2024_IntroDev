## **Debrief**
- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

I’m making a character that can enter others' mental world and clean their mind. The player must read the hint and the manual on the post and know what he needs to do next. Then, go to the portal to enter the next room. Each room has a memory, which is shown in the drawing. The player must connect the water gun to the valve in order to wash out the drawing. The drawing basically shows the painful memories of the character the player needs to save. Drawings in different rooms require different times to be washed out. When the player progresses, the room also becomes brighter, which reflects salvation. Finally, the solitary boy is saved mentally by the player, and we can see his happy face at the end of the game.

I like the role-playing element in this game. The player is the soul cleanser who can wash out people’s bad memories. And putting players in this role makes the game interesting. Also, the process of washing is really satisfying; I like watching the drawing fade away. I think I show the words I chose in an abstract way. Instead of washing clothes or something else, the player can wash the memory, which is a cool superpower. I also like the animation I made, such as the portal.

I checked the GameMaker website and learned how to use sound play and sound stop functions. Also, I downloaded the sound effects and sprites from itch.io assets. I was stuck on the idea of creating a water pipe that could follow the character, especially connecting with the player in a straight line. When I asked ChatGPT; it said I should use drawing instead of using step because instance_creates cannot make a straight line easily, but Draw can make a straight line if you have the initial point and the player’s current location. So, I use the code it provides to draw the water pipe. This is useful advice.

I will continue to explore the new way to show the word I chose and try my best to create the new mechanics. Next time, I will add some decoration and special effects to the game to make it look appealing. Also, I think the narrative game needs a little puzzle-solving element. So, I want to combine the puzzle-solving elements with narration. Say, in this game, I can set a puzzle that requires washing different parts of the drawing.






## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*Yes, it met. My word is wash and I use the word in a context of washing someone's painful memory. By using the water gun to wash out the memory, I think it reflects the theme of my game.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*I think I'm making a unique indie game because of its unique theme and gameplay. If there's some puzzles in the game, it should be more fun.*


**Overall** - Pass


*There are many rooms and player will follow the guide to travel through each room and see the mental changes of the character by washing. The game is complete and interesting. *

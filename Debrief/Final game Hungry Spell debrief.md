## **Debrief**
- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?
-What is one piece of critque you will take into consideration and why?
-What is one piece of critique you probably wouldn't incorporate and why?
If you missed the final critique, and only if you missed the final critique, you may use the playtesting we did. 
This is due by end of day Friday, along side any final changes you make to your game. (If you choose to make changes to your game, please upload the new build to itch!)

I made a 2D platform game with unique mechanic and level. I like the strategy player supposed to use during the gameplay. Switching the mode of eating, hunger and normal is fun in the game.I also put effort to the level design. The tutorial level is aim to clarify each mechanic with the displayed words, and the first level seems hard but interesting. I used the asset from itch.io and I really like the art style presented in my game. Also, I asked the code help desk to figure out some code problems. Such as I was stuck in the platform, and the reason is I reset the move speed outside of the colliding function. Asking them questions really helps me a lot.

What I want to do next is the level design and mechanic. I think making each mode has their pros and cons looks good, and this doesn’t make one mode overpower so players won’t stick with it. For  example: eating mode is invincible but players can’t move. In normal mode, it consumes less energy but moves slower; in hungry mode, it consumes more energy but moves faster. Making the level is also exciting for this project. I like to try many times and figure out what I’m intuitively not good at, and focus on that to make the game harder and interesting. I think the level design is hard but really interesting if players can spent ten minutes to explore it. 

What I will do differently is that I will try to make parent and children object for elements so that the whole code doesn’t look messy. Next time I need to set the objects with same colliding functions to parent/children objects, such as platforms, ground and monsters. Otherwise, the code will be chaotic,


The feedback want to add is the lives and hunger. The feedback is useful because I realize that making 2 constrains like lives and hunger isn’t intuitive. It makes the game hard but not interesting. So I should combine them to one value, which is energy bar: hurting or starving will both cost energy. In this way, player only need to look at one value during this fast-pace game.


Focusing on only one mechanic, like starving if not eating fruit, is something that I wouldn’t take. That’s because  I want players to focus more than the level itself and I believe this is interesting. And deleting any other modes like eating or hungry mode, will not to do so. The only thing I failed to do is that the tutorial part because it doesn’t clarify the concept. I should let player familiarize the switch between modes and reinforce the core part.



## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5
It meets the words Hunger and Magic. Starving value gives a sense of Hunger, and the mode switching and level design exemplify Magic.

**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5
It’s a great small game. The level is compact and interesting.

**Overall** - 5
I like the mechanic and level I designed. Maybe I should clarify the mechanic more in the tutorial part.

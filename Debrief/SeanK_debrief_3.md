**## \*\*Debrief\*\***

In this project I created a racing co-op game where players are racing to see who can reach the finish line first. While starting at the highest point of the field, players face a series of obstacles that include moving platforms, slowing mechanisms, bouncing trampolines, and jumps. The first player is controlling through using the keys WASD and the second player uses the arrow keys. Also, the camera follows the player who in comparison to each other is in the front. If a player is quick enough and makes their opponent leave the screen, their opponent automatically loses and the quick player wins. This game creates a competitive environment. By having players face off in a head to head duel to see who is faster at completing the objective creates tension and thrill. Every second counts and every little mistake that happens within the game could be detrimental to the players outcomes. Having never made a co-op game it was interesting to see how I could use aspects of single player games and tweak them with slight changes and create a playable and fun multiplayer game. Also being restricted with the word “down,” I wanted to create a reverse obstacle climbing game. This game is similar to a platformer style type of game as it uses jumping, movement, and obstacles. A similar game that this project could have derived from is “Jump King.” While not incorporating the same frustration that comes with “Jump King,” the series of obstacles and preciseness that players have can help to contribute to an advantage on the playing field. Both games also incorporate an emphasis on jumping. I envision that I could approach the composition of this game by incorporating more complicated obstacles and also obstacles that are more visually appealing. I would like to have more moving obstacles that create more intricacies with the gameplay and having more variety in which obstacles can be approached. I think that this would add a level of thinking on top of mechanical skills that would add a layer of thinking on top of needing mechanical skills. Having more obstacles with a more representational depth that can allow players to more easily identify the obstacles and know how to avoid them. Another obvious way to increase the professionalism of this game is by improving the overall graphic style to have a more immersive environment including less of a simplistic styles and rather basing it off a theme such as a jungle forest theme.

**## \*\*Self Evaluation\*\***

**\*\*Execution\*\*** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*I think that my project fits the theme of “down” very well by incorporating elements of the co-op.*

**\*\*Scope\*\*** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4

I think that my project reflects a fun co-op game, but lacks professionalism in aspects such as obstacles that could be improved with clarity and difficulty.

**\*\*Overall\*\*** - Pass

I think that my game incorporated all the requirements of the assignment while also having effort and creativity.

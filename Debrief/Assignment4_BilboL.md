## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

The theme I used for this assignment is tomorrow. I use the genre of survivor-like games to convey this theme. Players need to survive under the attack of an increasing number of enemies and survive to the second date. However, while making this game, I totally forgot about this theme and didn’t prepare any art sources to demonstrate the theme. But I guess the idea of tomorrow is still clear.

For the inventory, first, I decided to create one that can automatically sort themselves and players can choose the way to sort - newest, highest dps, most expensive, etc. However, it would be too difficult if I made it this way. I have to create different kinds of items and give them abilities. The inventory itself may not be the problem, but it takes a lot of extra effort to make new weapons and items. 

Thus, I decided to make a different kind of inventory. Fortunately, I found a tutorial for an inventory where players can drag items from one place to another. Following the tutorial, the process of building inventory worked well. Then I imitated the tutorial’s way and created another inventory of weapons so that players can drag the weapon they want to change. 

After building the code for inventory, I started to work on enemy generation and their actions. While I wanted to create enemies with more vivid actions, in the Survivor genre, enemies just seem to rush at the player and do nothing else. So I just keep it simple. It saves me a lot of time.
For the enemy generation, I make them generate on the map randomly, as long as they do not collide with the players. However, there may still be some enemies generated close to the player. It may be better if I tell the players beforehand that enemies will form, or if I generate them outside the screen 

Due to time restrictions, I didn’t include much flavor in this game. The player can only choose from two weapons which have different damage and shooting speeds. Originally, I planned to let enemies randomly drop new weapons. However, after adding the features, I realized that it still takes a lot of time to handle the case where the inventory system reaches its limit, so I deleted it.

	
## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 3

Survival till tomorrow is the way I meet the theme, but I might need more ar assets to demonstrate it.

**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5

The workload is just fine and I'm satisfied with the inventory system.



**Overall** - Pass

The inventory system works. I may look back to this code when I need to build a new inventory system.

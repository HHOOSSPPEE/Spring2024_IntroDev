**## \*\*Debrief\*\***

In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

In this project I created an inventory based game that focuses on the topic that I chose “alarm.” With players having limited time, they are given a list of ingredients in which the players have to put together in the according order. The items that are included in the orders are the bun, patty, lettuce, tomato, sauce, and cheese. To collect the items, players must walk over to the station that has the ingredient set and click on the item. Sometimes having duplicate items within the burger, players must then collect two of the same item within the burger. When the player has the burger put together they may click the submit button to send out their order. Additionally, if the player messes up the order, they are allowed to clear the inventory, making them have to start from scratch to remake the burger. When each burger is finished, the player’s point increases and the time to make the next burger is shortened, making it more difficult to obtain points. When the player is playing, they feel the pressure of the time which makes them feel like they must act fast. What I liked about this project is that it allowed me to better understand the implementation of an inventory system within a game. In my inventory I included the numbers next to the ingredient that allows the players to know how many of that item that they are carrying. Creating a properly working inventory was definitely one of the biggest struggles of this project. While struggling to put together an inventory system successfully at first, I used the in class material that was covered to mainly set up the functions and also resorted to YouTube to help understand how to create the inventory. Something that I would change next time would be fixing the inventory that is displayed on the top because it does not always display the ingredients in the order collected due to GameMaker’s ds\_map system. I would also like to improve more player interaction with the food making process which I think would make the game more fun to play. In addition, having actual animations from the player will make the

game more visually appealing by engaging the players with the actual process of putting together the burgers. Having on screen pop-ups would also be very beneficial because currently, the clarity of the user interface needs to be improved for better player experience.

**## \*\*Self Evaluation\*\***

**\*\*Execution\*\*** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 4

*\* I think that my game while including an aspect of the alarm could be more focused on the alarm itself.*

**\*\*Scope\*\*** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5

*\*I think that my game tied together both the inventory and the alarm system fairly well.*

**\*\*Overall\*\*** - Pass

*\*I included all the key elements that are necessary for the requirements.*

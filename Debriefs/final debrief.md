## **Debrief**
I had a clear vision when i starts to doing the game. I think it is a perfect game to combine the dress up theme word since one of the major content of this game is to create a person. It just need to add some feature. It is not a hard process to do the task since my path is to change the sprite of a same object in order to achieve the effect of change cloth. However I did encounter some trouble, for instance I draw all of my sprites in different layers at procreate, i thought it will be a good way to separate the file pictures, but it also make it hard to change cloth in Gamemaker since they are not in the exact same spot, and there are many empty space with the sprite. So I did some rework to make every cloth on the top left angle so that everything will be in the same spot. Meanwhile, the logistic of change sprite is also pretty tricky, it did not work as what i expected at the first, luckily I got it solved during the office hour. The add name feature is relatively an easy thing to do, I might only need to do something that make sure only keyboard inputs happens in this certain room will be recorded as the name.

I used to want to make a room that all small people will walk around and you will be able to check each person's status or traits by simply click that person. I thought it was easy and i know how to make it until I start to do it. Its really different with the pseudo code of arrays in my brain, I know that i need to use ds_list and many other thing to achieve it. Thus I kind of lower my ultimate goal, I made another to display the information of the person right after the player created them, but it will not be able to store or memorize previous person created. So its kind of different with the loop gameplay i expected earlier that gonna make a huge change and feeling to the game.

For the feed back, I think i will definitely take the advice of change the UI. I know there is a huge part of the gameplay happens in this room, so the UI should be more clear and easy to read information for player. So with a better UI it will increase player experience a lot. I might not consider to add the feature that persons will interact with each other based on their traits when they at the Earth. It is a good idea for a game, and i can see how the game might looks like. However, one of my expectation with the game is that player can input the traits so that kind of make it hard to exist with this feature. 


## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 4

*I think it is majority good, could be better with sounds*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 3.5


*I think the scope  can be a little bit more bigger by adding more elements *


**Overall** - Pass


*I think it's good work! I like it at least*

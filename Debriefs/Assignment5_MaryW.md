## **Debrief**

*For my final project, I ended up making a management game about running a news agency for birds. I expanded on my first narrative game project using the theme “breaking news.” One of my favorite parts of my finished product is the art, which is almost entirely from an asset pack I found on itch. I think it looks good and fits my game well. Another thing I enjoyed was programming the branching dialogue system, which I followed a very helpful YouTube tutorial for and am very happy with the result. Besides YouTube and Itch, playtests with my peers were a very helpful resource for me, and helped me improve the game in areas I had overlooked. One of my classmates gave me a great suggestion for the game’s name. Some feedback I received that I would implement in the future is to add more tasks similar to fixing the printer, to add to the sense of urgency and give the player more to do. Some players also suggested adding some visual feedback to indicate number increases, which I think would add to the juice and feedback of the game. I initially received feedback saying that I should show the effects of each choice to the player before they make them, which I chose not to implement as I think it would make the game too easy and predictable. Many things went wrong with making this game. My animation system broke at the last second and I had no idea how to fix it, so it isn’t present in the final game. I also wanted NPCs to randomly become interactable throughout the game, but the system I developed to make it happen didn’t end up working either. In the final game, all the NPCs are always interactable and repeat the same dialogue lines for eternity. I also would have liked to spend more time on the writing of the game, and making it more “bird-esque” with puns and other jokes. I never intended the news stories to be the center of the game, but I think the dialogue and environment could have been a bit more bird-adjacent. I’m mostly happy with how the game turned out, despite its bugs. Overall, it has been a fun experience learning more about GameMaker this year and learning it’s capabilities. I’m excited to move onto Unity next semester and learn more about game development and programming.*

## **Self Evaluation** 

**Execution** - 4

*My project met the theme very well, but did have some bugs and general unfinishedness that I would have liked to be complete. *

**Scope** - 4

*I think my game was mostly well-scoped, as I didn’t intend it to have too many features. However, I think it may have ended up having too few. *

**Overall** - Pass

*I completed the assignment requirements and submitted a polished expansion of one of my previous projects.*

## **Debrief**
Crafting this narrative game has been a truly enjoyable experience, especially since it has evolved into a visual novel. The implementation of a dialogue system has been particularly satisfying, offering the flexibility to showcase my dialogues and navigate through various dialogue options and branches seamlessly. What's more, the ease with which I can switch between the dialogue speaker's name, profile, and adjust text is commendable. All credit goes to Nick Mintypython, whose dialogue system tutorial on YouTube has been instrumental in this development. The youtube and gamemaker manual are definitely great sources of mine where I wrote all my code based on these two.

Improving the dialogue system in my visual novel game is an ongoing process. Currently, the system primarily focuses on switching dialogue topics through an action function. This approach changes the content and type of dialogues, whether they're options-based or standard narratives. However, visual novels are inherently visual experiences, and my implementation does not yet fully integrate background changes with the progression of dialogue, which is typically triggered by the player pressing the spacebar.

To address this, I've devised a game state framework consisting of two main statuses: Explore and Dialogue. This framework allows for a clearer delineation between the game's exploration phases and dialogue interactions. For each state, I've introduced a variable to specify the appropriate sprite or the current dialogue topic. As the game expands with more topics, the amount of the switch statement increases, necessitating further refinement to seamlessly integrate visual changes with the narrative flow, enhancing the overall coding efficiency.

Besides the technical part of the game, I’ve also done a lot of script writing for my game too. Although I wasn’t able to fully demonstrate the story in my game due to the short period of time, I am still pretty excited about my script and am willing to finish it in the future.

Before the game even begins I made a small game that indicates the hardness of giving birth to a girl and being tangled by the plants, and it’s actually implying the future plot which I wasn’t able to incorporate into. The story is basically about Jess, the main character, explore in this Goddess Village that values female over male, which is extremely unusual at the time. As Jess explores the village, she slowly find the truth behind this village. This village practices "valuing females over males" due to a past of valuing males over females, which led to excessive killings and a curse causing severe pain and limited lifespan for men. To break the curse, they worship a goddess and prioritize females. Only young girls and women over 30 are visible in the village, with rituals surrounding female children and a deceptive practice involving the village leader, who is male. Girls are implanted with a seed that blooms into a flower, believed to counteract the curse. Men consume these flowers to mitigate curse effects, with the belief that happiness in girls before age 14 enhances the flower's power. Marrying a former saintess and consuming her blood or engaging in intercourse is believed to stop the curse's effects. Their preference for females is superficial, driven by benefits rather than genuine esteem, with a deep-rooted desire for males. The ritual and village leadership are male-dominated; women are burdened with labor, their care limited to protective measures that restrict freedom under the guise of safety. The proclaimed female prioritization lures women to the village, where non-compliant ones face brutal punishment. This sinister strategy not only perpetuates the curse but also attempts to isolate the village, albeit with occasional lapses allowing outsiders in.

Nevertheless, I've come to understand that the narrative scope I envision is vast. Fully conveying the story's message and unraveling its plot requires significant time for meticulous planning of conversations and exploration sequences to achieve comprehensive development. 

While playing my peers' work this Monday, I found it to be disappointing that my work wasn’t completed. Seeing other‘s works and comparing them to mine, I've recognized the importance of gameplay mechanics and the completeness of the game experience. 

I will probably not repeat what I did this time. What I will repeat is probably just the implementation of a dialogue system.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 3

*I think I'm trying to explore and anti feudalism on gender, but because the story wasn't complete, I didn't really show it out through game*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 2


*I only made the intro, and the art is kinda rush. the 2 points are for my dialogue system*


**Overall** - Pass


*I think I will take some credit into finishing the overall structure. What I've left to do is the labor work where you copy paste each individual dialogues in and draw the background.*

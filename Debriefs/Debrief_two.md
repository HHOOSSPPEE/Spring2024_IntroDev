## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the gameâ€™s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

I'm really enjoying making this narrative game. I've ended up making a visual novel game. I really like how I've implemented a dialogue system where it allows me to give it the oportunity to present my dialogues and switch between dialogues and options choosing. There's also Branching dialogue system which I've also implemented. I also really like how I could easily switch between dialogue speaker's name, profile and adjust the texts accordingly. (Give credit to Nick mintypython, who wrote this dialogue system and made a youtube video tutorial of it).

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*Write your elaboration within the asterixis*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*Write your elaboration within the asterixis*


**Overall** - Pass/Fail


*Write your elaboration within the asterixis*

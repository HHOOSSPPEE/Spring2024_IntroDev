## **Debrief**
The final project has come and gone. The process was pretty interesting overall. I decided to iterate on the game by really breaking down some of the feedback I had gotten on the original games narrative. It began with taking the most vital piece of feedback, that the original games lore felt cool but vague, and fixing it. I wrote a lore document that broke down the history of the world and what plays into the religions the game centers around. I then created a magic system and story docs that fit into the world of the game, making sure that everything felt fleshed out. While this may have been very different from the process of other students in the class, I really approached it from a narrative design perspective first. When that was done I began reworking elements of the game itself. The biggest challenge that I needed to deal with was how to create cutscenes. For whatever reason, I found the sequences in game maker to be extremely temperamental and often more work to figure out that I felt was needed. I instead opted for a cutscene system that was hard coded. This ended up being a bit cobbled together with most of the “animations” relying on button inputs that are tracked from advancing dialogue. They work for the simple art style and dialogue system but would need to be reworked for the final version of the game. Then when I had figured those out, I worked on getting the story rewritten throughout the game. It now feels very different and much more like the beginning of something bigger than something incomplete. When the game got shown in class it didn’t receive a ton of feedback, but the most helpful comments were about font accessibility. It was something that I had realized was a problem the night before I submitted the game, and while I didn’t have time to implement a different font option, I thought it was very helpful to keep in mind. Overall I am proud of how this has turned out and can see a world in which, once I learn unity, I build out the games combat and magic gameplay.





## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*My added theme was command, and this showed up in the added lore and in the clear emphasis of the Path of Akosh being a command from Yaogai.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*I spent alot of time building out the narrative which is key for a narrative based game. I made sure to implement just enough that it makes sense and feels improved, while allowing much of the original to remain.*


**Overall** - Pass


*This game was successful in improving and iterating on the original. It retains much of what made the first interesting while also improving in many ways.*

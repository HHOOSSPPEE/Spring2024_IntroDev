## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the gameâ€™s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

In this project, I made a workshop where players can drag things around to synthesize new things, there is also a chest for players to store items in, because of the space constrain, the player needs to take a certain composition path or use the chest to store items for more space to synthesize. What I like about this game is the part about dragging items and the system of limited space, the player is required to compose with strategy. One of the things that helps me a lot is the code of InventoryAdd, which makes the storage logic of the chest. Also, the ds_map code is very helpful for this assignment, it allows me to store different amounts of items in the program. It's an unfinished project and has a lot of bugs. For example, clicking the left part of the screen will cause the game to crash and synthetic shirts do not consume items. The biggest problem is that when I uploaded the html format, it worked differently with Windows mode, causing the game not to work properly. Next time I will add the mechanism of taking things out of the chest, in the current version, the chest can only store things and view, if the player can get things out of the chest, it can provide more strategy.

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include them in a paragraph format.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:

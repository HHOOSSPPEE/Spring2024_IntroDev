## **Debrief**
My theme for this project was “ghost-hunting” so I decided to combine it with inventory by creating items for players to pick up. I turned out to design a simple 2d game where the player navigates through the map to collect items and capture ghosts using them. Creating the inventory system was very challenging so I didn’t spend much time on level design. 

My inventory consists of five fundamental functions. Firstly, it shows all items with a name and an icon next to it. By hovering the mouse over each, players are able to see descriptions of the selected items. Also, by clicking on the selected item, players can utilize its function. By pressing “backspace,” players are able to throw away the selected item to create space for new items since the inventory has a limited amount of 5 slots. Players can also reorder items by pressing up and down keys to move the selected item. Finally, by pressing “I,” players could choose to pull up or hide the inventory. The functions of the inventory were pretty basic but it meets up the needs of this game. The development process was very challenging since I am not familiar with designing inventory systems. I watched several youtube videos to learn about it and eventually decided to use arrays and structs to realize the functions of my inventory.

I was basically satisfied with how the inventory turned out, but reflecting on the project I wish I could improve it a bit. First of all, I tried to allow players to manage items in the inventory by dragging them around using the mouse, but I didn’t quite figure out how to make that work. Also, I could have added a background for the inventory so that it looks more like a backpack the player carries. Additionally, I could develop the levels more so that the play experience could be better. I feel like the idea of “ghost-hunting” wasn’t fully developed now. For example, one item could have the function of attracting ghosts and could be placed down as a bait. There could also be more weapons/ghost-capturing tools for the player to choose from. Moreover, the two different types of ghosts had different features but there is no clear indication of it. Next time I would reach out for more help and conduct more extensive playtesting to refine the game’s performance and user experience.

## **Self Evaluation**
**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 4/5

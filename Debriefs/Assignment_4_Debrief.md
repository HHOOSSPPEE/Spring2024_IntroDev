## **Debrief**
I ended up making a small game about a cat wandering around an island, collecting fruits or desserts and selling it to two different farmers. One farmer only bought fruits while the other only bought desserts. When a food is picked up from the ground, it is added to a fixed inventory. Additionally, the food picked up would prompt another food to generate at a different location. To remove the food from the inventory, players would need to sell it for money (which I didn’t implement). By pressing a button, it would remove all of the food that the farmer would buy (desserts or fruits). After, players can go around the map collecting food, selling, and repeating the process. An aspect I liked about this project was the ability to pick up objects and add the same food to the inventory. Initially, I had a hard time getting the food to be the same when picked up and stored. For example, when picking up a cake, an apple would appear in the inventory. But after googling and reviewing the Gamemaker manual, I was able to find a way to grab the image index and redraw it in the inventory slot. Additionally during selling food, I wasn’t sure how to only remove specific objects one by one. As of right now, I have food being removed all at once. Something else I liked was the additional window for selling food. When the player presses the spacebar to interact with a farmer, a new window pops up with information about the farmers and what you can sell to them. I thought that additional multiple farmers would be nice so that you could explore that map a bit more than if there were only just one farmer. 

I think I was able to efficiently reduce the amount of objects I had in a room by drawing sprites instead of creating objects. But I think I still need improvement on organizing my code. At one point, I was trying to find where I drew a sprite for 10 minutes after checking each object at least 5 times. I think I’m still struggling a bit with deciding where I should write code for certain objects. Because most objects appearing/ disappearing relies on the interaction of the character, most of my code fell under the player object. But some code was under other objects, making it hard to go back and locate them.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*3 - I think the game does follow “marketing,” as you are technically selling things to the farmers. But it still lacks the advertising part of marketing.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*4 - The game itself isn’t that complicated, but I found a lot of difficulty implementing the inventory system.	Because I’m unfamiliar with creating an inventory, I think what I was able to achieve is satisfactory.*


**Overall** - Pass/Fail


*Pass - I was pretty happy with what I accomplished, considering that this was something new. I was able to create what I wanted in the end.*

## **Debrief**
So I ended up continuing to make my narrative game about The Goddess Village. I’ve also improved my dialogue system so that it will allow developers to easily switch between backgrounds or draw anything in the room and is able to remove them any time, and move them to any places in the room. The only thing that might not be as good is that I’ve decided to write my whole dialogues in this one script instead of using a json file to write it and then parse it into the control. However I do think this will be an easy fix because as of now, the script is basically a json file except that it’s formatted differently.

I really enjoyed the process of writing my stories out and planning and thinking about what the player will have to do, what puzzles can be solved that could imply the story I’m going to tell later. The designing of the part where I let the player to slowly explore over the village took me some time, and though it is challenging to design dialogues between NPCs to lead the player to some hints, the challenge is by itself fun.

There’s this one website https://konachan.net/, that contains lots of different free assets. By searching no_human #scene, you will be able to find lots of free japanese styled scenes. However, it is difficult if you are making a narrative game and you want different scenes to be somewhat connected, it’s hard to find the exact background you want. Or if you want to have the same scene in your game but with a different time period, it is likely that you won’t find any. There might also be some AI generated arts on there, but it’s hard to tell which are and which aren't. However this website is a little bit suspicious, but it will help if you are making a demo. 

Next time, I don’t want to make visual novel narrative games anymore. Because I feel like yes I learned a lot about coding a system, but to be honest the narrative system is kind of useless since there are a lot of extensions out there already and I could have just used theirs and properly using a json file to build the game. Mine is just a functional dialogue system that does all the basic things it needs to do. The narrative game also just doesn’t seem like a good choice when presenting on a final because there are just simply too many words. It will be easier for most players, and more interesting for players to just learn the mechanics and play. After seeing all of the other final works, I found that there are many more creative games being created. I feel like I was limited by the idea of making narrative games and I just feel disappointed for not having any ideas of creating new, interesting games.


## **Self Evaluation**
*I think overal I did well and I've met all the criteria*

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*Yes, it's the story is about to figure out the truth behind the village and whether if the people there are innocent*

**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*I managed to stop at a dialogue where it allows players to feel the wierdness of the village but not telling too much out*


**Overall** - Pass


*I think I did pretty well.*

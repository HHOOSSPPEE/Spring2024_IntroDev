## **Debrief**
Generally speaking, I am satisfied with this assignment. At least I believe I have told a good story. 

As for this project, my initial objective was quite clear. From the first moment I saw the card "Sacrifice," I felt it was a classic narrative theme worth writing an interesting story about. I had two different ideas for the specific plot. One involved someone dying unexpectedly, like falling from a building, but the public interprets this accident as a political act or protest. An accidental death becomes a politically charged sacrifice.

However, I felt I didn't come up with a dramatic ending for this idea and shelved it for now. Perhaps I'll continue to ponder it in the future. The other story, which is the current version, is about a character actively sacrificing themselves, in contrast to the passive sacrifice story mentioned earlier. The narrative game mode is navigated through left-click interactions with the screen, advancing the story.

This is the game style I prefer, and I'm glad I made it, especially with the scenes transitioning along with the dialogue. I think I could challenge those Japanese visual novel games or even graphic adventure games from the 80s in the future. Apart from the game mode, I'm quite fond of the visuals I've created. Currently, I'm certainly not an artist, but that doesn't stop me from liking my own drawings. I'm not sure how other players would perceive the gaming experience, but if they enjoy my game, my rough drawings might add to the story.

Perhaps the most useful resource for me in this assignment was Procreate, where all of my images were drawn. It's relatively simple to use so I can easily draw by hand.

Honestly, I believe there's still much room for improvement in the final product. For example, color-coding the text to differentiate between different characters' dialogues. (Although I didn't manage to implement this, I deliberately emphasized character names when writing dialogue to minimize confusion.) Perhaps in future projects, I'll store the lines for different characters in separate arrays to help with color coding.

At the same time, I hope to implement Save/Load functionality. I have some ideas, like saving the current array index when a specific line is reached. But I'm unsure how to simultaneously save the visuals. Additionally, I have no clue how to save local files in Gamemaker, so I didn't attempt it in this project.

## **Debrief**

I ended up making a game about fencing, the prompt was foil so I thought it was a perfect opportunity. I am pretty happy with the final product. I was able to create 2 main mechanics, lunge and parry which are supposed to add some strategy and variation in gameplay. I coded in a system called right of way which is an important part of real foil fencing. Basically whoever is attacking will get the point. The first way you can get right of way is by advancing before your opponent, the next way is to parry your opponent’s blade. I wanted to make the game about timing and try to closely reflect the basics of real foil fencing. This was where I added the scorekeeping mechanic, there is one in real fencing anyway so It was also perfect. I liked having to think about what would be really fun to play with another person. Trying to envision what would get people to yell or get passionate about the game was fun, I am not sure if I got the feeling I wanted but, I was trying to channel some feel from Super Smash Bros or Street Fighter. It was challenging to try to think about what was the right amount of movement and what felt right especially because I wasn’t play testing with any other people, I was just by myself. I didn’t look up that many resources, but now that I am sitting here writing this I should have looked up FX and particles, it would have been super cool to have a spark fly when a player parries. Definitely for the next project I want to experiment with FX and any visual flairs that only add a little spice to the game. Next time I would have tried to figure out how to move to feel better, maybe have a little slide after you let go of the movement key because it is a very movement-based game. I would have also wanted to add more abilities maybe a Flèche or a fake out move. I feel this could either add a lot more strategic options, or it would just make the game too complex. I feel like it would be cool to see a full-on multiplayer game that is based around fencing. I am excited to see people’s reactions. I ended up feeling pretty comfortable with coding these mechanics so next time I will try to really have one very cool and interesting mechanic so I can try to learn something new and more complex.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5


*5/5 - I feel I really got down the basics of foil fencing into a very short and sweet game.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*4/5 - I really think I should have added a particle effect just because it would be cool and helpful visually but other than think I feel like I got some good mechanics down.*


**Overall** - Pass/Fail


*Pass - I do really like the simpleness of the game, I really want to see how people play it, and if its even good.*

## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

The game I made was an evolution of the multiplayer game and an alternate version of Hangman. In the initial multiplayer game the point was to avoid falling objects but in the new version it was changed to have both players working together to figure out the unknown word but also for one player to grab more of the missing letters than the other person. The best aspect of the project was the ability to continue iterating on an idea and improving the design in addition to a simple code assignment. Normally the time allotted is just enough to figure out how to even make the idea we have. Hands down the most useful resource were the office hours. Being able to work on what I do know and can figure out then asking for help was a rewarding experience. There felt like an actual sense of growth and learning something because I would keep building upon a set foundation for a long period of time. I understand that it was a special case since it was the last week of the semester, however I think that could be useful to other students in the future. For a project like this in the future I think being able to rapid prototype multiple ideas would also be able to help improve the final rendition of the project. While it was something suggested during the pitch presentations I was having difficulty with actually making the base idea so I missed the chance to have different ideas tested out. From the final presentation I would like to incorporate the feedback of slowing down the movement of the letters so that it feels more deliberate to grab them instead of a random mad dash for them. Them moving slower would also allow me to incorporate the typical feature of hangman where if you grab the wrong letter then you get punished for it. Another thing I would want to incorporate that I don’t think was mentioned, is to distinguish the color of the letter displayed on the word to reflect who grabbed which letter so that it’s easier to tell who won at the end rather than people being confused. One piece of feedback I wouldn’t incorporate is changing the background color. The simple black and white and minimal color makes the letter stand out more and makes them more legible as well as the word being displayed on screen.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 3

*WWhile there are no explicit examples of secret incoporated the word being figured out is a secret from the players so that may justify the theme*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*With my limited knowledge of code I think the project was scoped well. I was able to finish it comletely and I was able to learn things I did not know how to do originally.*


**Overall** - Pass/Fail


*Pass - The project met all of the requirements, it was feature complete, and it matched the theme that I was working with.*

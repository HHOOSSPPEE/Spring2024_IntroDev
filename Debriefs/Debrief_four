## **Debrief**
I made my own inventory system for this project 

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 3

*I think I'm trying to explore and anti feudalism on gender, but because the story wasn't complete, I didn't really show it out through game*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 2


*I only made the intro, and the art is kinda rush. the 2 points are for my dialogue system*


**Overall** - Pass


*I think I will take some credit into finishing the overall structure. What I've left to do is the labor work where you copy paste each individual dialogues in and draw the background.*

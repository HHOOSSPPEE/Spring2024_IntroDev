## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

I ended up making a very abstract game where you control the player and the path that they walk on. My prompt was blind so I wanted to make a very strange-looking game nothing really concrete. I liked experimenting with this game, I went through a bunch of different ideas and then finally settled on a weird one. Originally I was going to have it be a platformer where you have to catch things that fall from the sky but that didn’t really make sense with the theme. While I was trying to make an object that shot out other objects to catch it created a super interesting stream of blocks, it looks like a stream or a path that you could walk on. So I changed the controls to a top-down moving in all directions with WASD. For the inventory, I used a YouTube tutorial to create it. I followed the whole tutorial but it was still not working. I had to ask some of my classmates for help and then I eventually got it working. I couldn’t really understand the inventory lecture so I also struggled to use the code that was provided in the discord. Next time I would maybe try to find a different tutorial or ask more questions during the lecture. I also did it very late working until the last minute, but it was the first time I did that and it really stressed me out so I will not do that again. I did feel like I learned a lot though about functions, I don’t think I learned anything about arrays or lists, I am still a little confused about those. I felt like I understood about 70% of what my code was so that probably isn’t great. I also wanted to make the inventory apart of the game which I didn’t get a chance to do. I wasn’t able to do any art but I think that was ok for this assignment because of how coding-heavy this assignment was. I think it is most helpful for me to fully use this class to understand coding because I don’t really want to do pixel art that much anyway. Now I am brainstorming about what I want to do for my final project, I am thinking that I will try to combine a lot of the things I have already coded into one project. Maybe something similar to blasphemous.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*4 Yes I feel like I met the theme just because my goal was to make it strange for Blind.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*4 I feel like I might have been able to add a little more but other than that I feel like I have a working game that you can replay*


**Overall** - Pass/Fail


*Pass - it was my most experimental game*

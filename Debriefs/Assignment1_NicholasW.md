## **Debrief**
I am pretty happy with the project, I am not really a programming type of guy so it was rewarding just working hard on this project and not needing to follow tutorials. I think what I want to get out of this class is an understanding of the art and creative side of game dev. Maybe to implement creative uses of 2D art and storytelling. I do want to push myself with programming as well. I thought that the class tutorials were really helpful but in some parts, I am still a little bit confused with how the jumping works. 
I think I am happy with all the work I put in, so next time I want to keep up the same amount of work. But next time I want to try and push myself to program mechanics that I donâ€™t understand. I felt like I was just re-enforcing what I already knew, which is still great! But I also want to push myself more. But I also want to figure out what will be the most important skills I can take out of this class.
I am more interested in art and animation so maybe I can try to push those aspects into my games. I am also wondering how this class can help me/ prepare me for the industry if I want to work in AAA. I guess I am just wondering about the Game Design BFA program in general.

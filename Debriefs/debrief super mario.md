## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the gameâ€™s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

In this project, I recreated the map of the first level of Super Mario Bros. I recreated the game's camera mechanic so that Mario follows in the center of the screen when moving to the right, and stops following when moving to the left and makes it stopping for Mario to move to the left, this mechanic restores the original game's mechanic and I think it is one of my favorite things about this project. The most helpful resource for me in this project was the tiles maps I found for Mario's tiles on Pinterest, and the tiles template system in Game Maker, which is a very powerful feature for making level maps or 2D scenes very quickly. The part of this project that I think needs improvement is the gravity system for the enemies, they don't implement falling very well.

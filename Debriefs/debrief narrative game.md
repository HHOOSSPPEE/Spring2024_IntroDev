## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the gameâ€™s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

During the development of this narrative game project, I made a text game where the characters go on an adventure to save their village, I spent a lot of standup drawings for this game and designed different endings that will be triggered by different dialogues, during the process of making this narrative game, I encountered some troubles. For example, to turn the page to show the text, the way I used is to build a text library in the create class of the object of the text box, and then set the object of the switch case to change the index of the text and image in the obj index when the mouse clicks on it to achieve the effect of turning the page. I will rework the story in the next design to get more endings or add more gameplay.

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*Fits in with the narrative game theme*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 3


* Lacks a bit of gameplay*


**Overall** - Pass

* Adding more gameplay would be good*

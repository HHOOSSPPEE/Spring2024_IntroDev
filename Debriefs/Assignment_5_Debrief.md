## **Debrief**
For my final project, I ended up refining my inventory game because there were many things that I wanted to expand upon. The game begins with the cat starting at the house, where they must then wander around the map, collecting food off the ground. There are two different farmers on the first map that purchases different items: sweet and healthy food. At the end of the day, players must return to the house by 12 am. Otherwise, they will lose 20% of their money. The cycle repeats until players are able to purchase keys from the key seller. These keys open up gates to bridges that lead to different islands. The cheapest, yellow, opens up to a small island with more of the same food. The second, blue, opens up to a larger item that introduces a new type of food and a new farmer. The new type of food sells at a higher price, while the new farmer purchases anything. The most expensive, red opens to a large island that is full of the new food and a fisherman with a boat. Once the player buys a ticket for the boat, they complete the game. 

In this project, I liked the inventory of the character and sellers. Compared to the first game, I reworked the entire inventory system. While hovering over each item in your inventory, a description and price would pop up below. Additionally, when purchasing items from the key seller or boat man, the text would turn white when hovering over each item. In the first project, I had an issue of only selling what the mouse was hovering over. When I clicked the screen, all of the food seemed to disappear. However, with the help of a tutorial online, I was able to fix this issue while adding additional features mentioned before. 

Overall, I am pretty satisfied with what I was able to accomplish in this game. Some things I will repeat is looking for tutorials online with mechanics that I am having trouble with. The inventory system mechanic video helped me a lot. I also thought that my code was a lot more organized this time because I didn’t create as many objects. Instead, I created numerous sprites and drew them in draw events instead. Some things I would do differently are having my friends playtest the game throughout the production. During the final critics, my classmates said things that made me go “oh, that makes so much sense.” But when I was testing the game myself, I didn’t see any problems there. One critique was changing the location of the farmers: moving the farmer who bought everything to the beginning island and the other two to the additional ones. This way, it could reduce the amount of walking it takes for the character to reach each farmer and food. Additionally, the house is located on the opposite side of everything. As a result, it could take 2 hours just for them to walk across the island. However, I don’t think I’ll implement the critique that farmers would buy food for different prices. I don't think players look at prices that often and assume that all items are priced the same. Usually, when selling items in other games, I just spam click to get money quicker.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*5 - I think I successfully merged “marketing” and “key” together. The player could sell items to purchase a key, which unlocks more areas to explore.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*4 - I think I changed or added many new mechanics and features compared to the older game: inventory system, new character, new islands.*


**Overall** - Pass/Fail


*Pass - I was satisfied with what I accomplished in the final project. I spent a lot of time adding new features and playtesting it myself.*

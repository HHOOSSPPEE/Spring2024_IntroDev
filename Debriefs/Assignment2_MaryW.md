## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

My theme was zealot, and I made a short narrative game about exploring the house of a person that very strongly believed that birds are government drones. The game includes a character with four-directional movement that can be moved around a small house while the camera follows. The story is told through pop-up dialogue relating the inner thoughts of the main character, and somewhat through the environment and sound as well. While no birds can be seen, they can be heard throughout the house, giving the impression of them living in the attic or walls. The art used is from a creator on itch.io, and is probably what I like most about the project. I used sprite sheets to create my games environment, which I think has helped me improve my skills with them and how they work with game maker. I also enjoyed using sound as a method of storytelling, and enjoyed searching for one that fit my needs the best. The sounds were also taken off the internet, and wasn’t really something I had utilized in game maker before. Itch was most likely my most helpful resource during this project, as I used it to look through what art assets are available to me and think about what stories I could tell with them. I think next time I will try to make the scope of my game a bit bigger, as I think this game is too simple and I could’ve done more. I think the story as well as the area could've been longer and had more exploration aspects, with perhaps some secrets to discover about the zealot. I’ve gotten into the habit of checking my old projects to see how I programmed certain features, which I will probably continue doing. Overall I’m mostly happy with how this game turned out, as the visuals, sound, and short story came out how I wanted, but may be a bit too small.

## **Debrief**
I'm going to start this (sort of devlog) off with a mini rant. I HATE GAMEMAKER. Not in the way that it's bad at making games like processing was first semester, but I hate that it is crash prone, and that in updating my client I lost an entire weeks worth of work. I am a perfectionist. It shows up whenever I make any kind of art, and the last thing that helps with that, is losing out on work time. Then when I was going about recreating my game, I was hypercritical of everything, burnt, and unable to live up to the standard I set for myself. Anyways, anti-gamemaker rant over, I made what feels like a tech demo for a multiplayer puzzle adventure. Think Fire boy and water girl, but they share a body and need to fuse and unfuse in order to accomplish puzzles. This was how I was going to address the theme Sever, and I was really happy with it. The first version that was lost, had these "gateways" that a player could only cross if they were in the right form. they felt a bit simple, so when it came to recreating the game I ditched them. I sort of regret that, but I can always implement them again later. The biggest issues I had with this project was making the split functionality. not only did it require making 3 sets of character sprites, but it also meant finding a way to let two players control the different characters and letting them not break collisions when moving. Some collisions are still buggy, but hey, I got the split function working. One thing I wanted to emphasize was teamwork. In order to move while fused, both players have to hold down the same buton inputs as though they share one mind. When split, the teamwork is supposed to instead be coordinating different movements on their own. If I went back to this project I would want to lean into the teamwork more. Instead of having the glyphs all appeared at the beginning, I want players to have to help one another reveal them, making it more about communication than anything else. Lastly, I think I struggled with the implementation of a point tracking system. Not because it was difficult to implement, but because I wasn't sure how it fit into the game I was making. I'm honestly unhappy with how that shows up in the second room, and I hope that if I go back, I can get rid of this and let the visual change on the teleporter signal whats happening.



## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*I think I definitely met the theme of Sever, and ended up with an interesting interpretation of it.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4


*The original scope of this game was much bigger than what I ended up with. I think that in my "post deletion recovery" I managed to rescope the project, so while short, I could make it happen in the time I had left.*


**Overall** - Pass


*This game is short, its got some weird collisions, but I think the concept and some of the execution make it a creative take on a multiplayer puzzle game. The puzzles are way too simple, but I would say that as a tech/ normal demo, this project definitely passes.*

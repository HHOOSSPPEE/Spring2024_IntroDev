## **Debrief**
I ended up making a game about an ant that has to deliver a mysterious suitcase to its Queen. All the time you are traveling on the walls and ground and through holes in the walls. The ant gets the suitcase from another dying ant. I experimented with Animation and sounds which was fun. I wanted to work with cutscenes so I made a cutscene within a single sprite. I am interested to see how to code cutscenes. I want to do more art next time and focus way more visually than gameplay-wise. I wish I could have included my original vision which was an ant running away from a person shooting at it while it scurries along a white brick wall. But I was only able to complete the beginning of the game a little bit of the actual gameplay. I thought the sound tutorial was helpful. I also looked at some YouTube videos to help me do some basic mechanics. Right now it kind of feels like we are just reviewing what we have already learned in the introduction to programming, so I wish we could learn and understand some more complex subjects. I sunk a lot of time into trying to get the mechanics to work and not focusing on what I am interested in which is story and art. I feel like when I am a solo dev I have a lot less time to focus on the art, I wonder if there is a way to work around that. Maybe I could do a purely visual novel style next time. I am still trying to figure out what I am trying to get out of this class. Maybe I should completely focus on learning how to code in class so that I can focus on art outside of class, I am not sure yet. I am also still trying to figure out how much time I should put into these 2-week projects. Next time I will try to condense my ideas, I had a big idea for a section of the game but maybe I should just focus on 1 part of game dev for each project. For example, just mastering text boxes and art for this one would have been nice. Maybe for the next project, I will focus on pure mechanics. For some reason, GitHub isn’t working properly on my PC. I will have to ask about it next lab. Also, my PC laptop keeps disconnecting from the NYU wifi, but none of my other devices disconnect which is really annoying. 

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5/5

*There are many walls involved.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4/5


* I need to focus my energy on one area instead of trying to get it all.*


**Overall** - Pass/Fail - Pass


*I think it's a funny concept that involved the word “wall."*

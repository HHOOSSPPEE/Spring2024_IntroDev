In this game, I mainly do the elements of tank multiplayer battle, two players can control the two tank characters by controlling different buttons, and the game will randomly generate bunkers to increase the game uncertainty. The biggest challenge I face in this game is that I try to add the physical quantity of inertia into the game. Even though I used the same code for both tanks, the results were different, one of the tanks reflected inertia very well but the other tank didn't stop sliding until it hit the wall, which is the problem I'm going to solve.

### **2024 Spring** - Hudson J
### *Assignment 1* - Clone



## **Debrief**
I am not gonna lie, this project turned out way jankier than I wanted it to be. There were a few big glitches that took a long time for me to fix, and my lack of coding experience made them take even longer than I expected. I did meet the requirements of features set by the Mario group, but I wish I had more time to keep hammering away at this project. Game feel is a newer concept to me. Last semester the mentality that Pratt enforced was “get it to work, make it feel good later” so when it came to making this feel “less jank” I just didn't get there. If I was going to improve it, I would want to: Fix the collision Issues with Big Mario, Finish the “win screen” when you reach the castle, add additional power ups, fix weird movement of the blocks, bug fix, bug fix, bug fix. So while I’m not super happy with the result, I do know that I did what I was asked of, and with more time, could figure out the answers to all the issues I had. I think I would worry less about fixing some smaller bugs, and try to make the game feel more complete as a whole. Then I would look at the game feel, and make sure that my movement, and controls, felt “good”. This all takes more time than the 8 hours that I had, and more coding experience than my one semester. However, that being said, it is doable, and that gives me hope.



## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 4

*I beleive that I did a good job at completing a clone, but that there were some missing features and jankiness that stopped it from being AMAZING.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*I think I did a good job accomplishing the tasks set out by my group to receive full points.*


**Overall** - Pass


*I believe I passed this Assignment because I accomplished the set out tasks, and even amidst glitches, the game resembles its source material making it a sucessful clone.*

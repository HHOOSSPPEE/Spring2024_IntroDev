### *Assignment 2* - Narrative Game



## **Debrief**
I made a narrative walking sim. I know I know, that sounds boring, simple even! However, I got a bit carried away when it came to making assets and narrative storytelling. What was originally going to be an environmental story only, ended up needing a bit more guidance to come across fully. The biggest hurdle (other than making tons of assets and tiles) was figuring out how to make a working dialogue system. This took FOREVER! I tried following a few different tutorials, and none were really giving me the effect I wanted. Most guides were for advanced rpgs, or life sim type games, and their code wasn't working to well with mine. So while I initially overlooked GameMakers own tutorial for it, it ended up being the one i went with. Their guide gave me the basics, and then I was able to restructure it for my project. The biggest thing too was that I wanted a bunch of different dialogues to be triggered by the environment. When I kept running into problems I took to the GameMaker discord and was able to find someone who taught me some valuable things about variable definitions. Not long after that I had the dialogue system working to my liking, and was able to infuse a new layer of narrative storytelling to the project. So, I ended with a game called "Path to Akosh" in which you play as a monk like person on a pilgramage through the ritual sites of their religion. However the whole time, they are questioning their faith. This was my take on the prompt "Influence". I wanted to make a story about community and religious influence on a persons beliefs. I think I was effective in that and I am proud of how it turned out. There are definitely some things that I wanted to add though. There is a section about self reflection, and I really wanted to code in a literal reflection onto the pool. There were some guides that taught how to do that, but I ended up thinking that if I had time or energy after, I could do it then. There is also an inherent linearity to the level design. In my perfectionist opinon, its a bit lazy level design. I wanted to make sure my players went in a specific direction by making a clear path from start to end. If I was going to change anything I would want to make the level design feel more organic, suggesting the player go a certain way rather than coralling them in against their will. There is also a LOT of reading. Thats not a bad thing, but I think some other type of gameplay, either puzzles or combat, would have made it feel a bit less repetitive. 



## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*I took the theme and RAN with it. I think this is a unique take on "influence" and I am happy with how I handled it.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*I think I did a good job keeping this project manageable. There were some things I was going to try adding, but knew that It just wasn't feesible in the time I had.*


**Overall** - Pass


*I think this game succeeds at telling a unique story, and has multiple intricate systems under the surface. It also has visuals I am very proud of, and a clear tone to its design!*

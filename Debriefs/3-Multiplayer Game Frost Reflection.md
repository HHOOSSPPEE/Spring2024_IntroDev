## **Debrief**
For the multiplayer project I ended up creating a 2-player cooperative platformer in which they work together to navigate through levels. My initial idea was to make a game centered around the theme of “mirror,” where the two players would perform similar actions but in divergent directions. Subsequently, I incorporated mechanics where one player’s(the reflection) actions would aid the other, fostering increased communication between them during the game. In addition, in this game I tried introducing typewriter effects to text and dialogues and it turned out to be more interactive than simply drawing text to the canvas. Another thing new is that I added a short intro animation to the game so players would be provided with more narrative context before they actually start the game. I deliberately structured the levels to facilitate gradual learning of block mechanics and movement manipulation. The players would practice in the first level, learn about red blocks in the next, orange blocks after that, and eventually then would come to the level where they demonstrate their acquired skills by navigating levels containing both types of blocks.

During the game development process, I encountered challenges with object animations, particularly issues arising from differing collision masks across frames, resulting in objects getting stuck after collisions. Eventually after seeking help, I was able to solve this problem. I also learned how to add typewriting effects to text through youtube videos.

Reflecting on the project, I recognized that I allocated excessive time to intro animations, compromising the development of a coherent narrative and a compelling conclusion. Additionally, playtesting revealed certain mechanics, such as the functionality of orange blocks, to be less smooth than anticipated. It turned out that even when the orange blocks were invisible, the player was actually able to collide with them. Finally, I didn’t have time to implement all my ideas, for example I thought about reflecting lights to create a path but didn’t try that in practice.

The project was overall satisfying. Next time I would stick on to coding gameplay mechanics more and add sprites to objects later, which is a good way to make actual progress in my project. However, I intend to conduct more extensive playtesting to refine the game's performance and user experience.

## **Self Evaluation**
**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 4/5
*It overall met my expectations, but I could do better on details.*

**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4/5
*Pretty good.*

**Overall** - Pass

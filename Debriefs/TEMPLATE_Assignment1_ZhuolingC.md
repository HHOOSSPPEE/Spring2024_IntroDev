## **Debrief**

I end up choosing Castlevania. Cloning this game with such complexity was challenging but fun. I am not the most satisfied with the project. I am happy that the attacking mechanics worked out though. I was first having trouble with how I make a separate collider only for the weapon, and I spawned another object at the exact 3 to 4 frames of the player animation. This question has troubled me for several projects and I am happy to find a universally applicable solution for future projects. Then the spawning position of the weapon collider was problematic, and I used a silly method to solve this: detect the direction of the sprite and adjust the offset of the spawning position of the weapon collider. There is certainly a more elegant way of implementing this that I hope to know in the future. What’s more, I planned to code at least 2 types of enemy AIs but I have only got the zombie worked.

For the project next time, I would like to make a detailed URL diagram to plan the program structure before coding. Because when more and more features are added, the code gets increasingly messed up. For example for the movement of going upstairs in Castlevania, when I tried to also make a downstairs movement, I realized that I had to change almost the whole structure of the algorithms to make it work. There was also another problem of sprite animations overlapping with each other and getting stuck in the attack state. Instead of carefully adjusting the animation frame for the solution of this time’s project, I should learn how to implement an animation state in Gamemaker. In summary, structure and plans! They are so important when comes to a big project.

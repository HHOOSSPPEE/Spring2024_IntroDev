### **2024 Spring Jiahe G**
### *Assignment 1- Kirby's Dream Land Clone Project*

## **Debrief**
The project was overall satisfying and I learned a lot about coding and Gamemaker. I've been familiar with tile maps and animations, so the initial settings were pretty straight forward. However, it was my first time using gravity in gamemaker and writing code dealing with "isGrounded," and I find it somewhat challenging. The most challenging part was the "float" function of Kirby, I tried out different codes but it still doesn't work properly. Setting the ground check variable kind of conflicted with the mechanics of double jump(the second jump as floating) and I was stuck on that. Instead of actually “floating,” I had to make it that you could jump higher when you hold the space key. In this regard I believe I could make more improvements next time to make it smoother. Also, I could’ve added collisions and Kirby's attacks.
For the project, the resources from The Spriters Resource and the Gamemaker documentation was very helpful. I also watched YouTube videos for additional help, but I spent a lot of time looking for the ones actually related to my work, and that was something I should spend less time on. I liked how we were separated into groups so that we could help each other. I had a problem stopping the camera when it reaches the border, but that question was resolved by asking my classmates.
Next time I would probably separate enemies, tiles and other instances in different layers so that later on it would be easier to manage them. In addition, I could do better on time management next time. I spent a lot of time fixing small issues, such as the appropriate speed for Kirby and each enemy that resembles the original game the most, but I should have given more time to major movements(double jump, attacks, suck power, etc.) If I finished the major parts first, I wouldn't be so rushed when I got sick. Also, I could be more flexible with my code, trying to redesign existing codes to satisfy the new mechanic. I think I did pretty well on sprites and animations and I would continue on that next time.

## **Self Evaluation**
**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 3/5
*I would say overall the game meets the requirements. I could do better on Kirby's abilities but other than that it works fine.*

**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4/5
*I did my best for a clone game. However I could do more with better time management.*

**Overall** - Pass
*It was fine^^*

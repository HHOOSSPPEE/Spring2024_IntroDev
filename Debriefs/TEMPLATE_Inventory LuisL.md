## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

    This project was difficult for a few reasons. While the demo given was certainly nice to add to general background knowledge I couldn’t find a way to implement it into my code because I didn’t quite understand how to utilize it. Due to this I defaulted to working with lists and while I’m certainly happy I was able to get them to work (to an extent) and integrate them into a for loop it was still very buggy. Also, the textboxes when clicking on the npc’s I think came out decently well. I could save some space and not have the screen too cluttered with individual text boxes but rather have some of them share a textbox and simply change the text depending on which npc you click on. Clicking on items after clicking on npc’s proved to be buggy too. After clicking on an npc you would have to click on the box to make the item spawn then click on the item again. After that, despite being added to the list which is shown using a debug message when actually trying to display that info the number of items in the list is always shown as one which I did not know how to fix. I think in the future for something like this I could look more into arrays as it seems to be the more commonly used tool and might have more tutorials and explanations on how to implement them into my project. Also, learning and understanding structs, I didn’t realize that the lecture was even a struct so when trying to learn about it more I didn’t even know what to search up. I think a lack of review on the types of variables that could be utilized in an inventory certainly hindered just how much I could make, let alone refine. Despite the difficulty I still think it was a good assignment, it built upon another assignment from intro to programming that involved using a type of inventory system as well. The theme of the game was meant to revelry and while the art certainly doesn’t convey that, the types of items and dialogue from your friend tells the “story” of a party going on and they need you to buy some food and drinks for the party. 

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 3

*The theme I worked with was revelry and while the npc do not look it nor does the background, the idea of shopping for a party is kind of there. Buying food and drinks for your friends party.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*I think the game is fairly well scoped. It wasn't too large nor too small and while it is certinaly buggy it is feature complete and kind of works. *


**Overall** - Pass/Fail
Pass
*The game is complete and has the main mechanic that was required. It could certinaly be better but it does have what was required.*

## **Debrief**
The project centered around the theme of "empathy" proved to be a fulfilling endeavor. Initially grappling with the task of conceptualizing a storyline, I drew inspiration from my personal experiences with my two beloved cats, ultimately crafting a narrative that explored the profound bond between pets and their owners—a love devoid of any conditions. Given the narrative nature of the game, I opted to incorporate an abundance of dialogue and text elements, a departure from my previous projects, which proved to be a fitting choice.
One of the notable challenges I encountered revolved around the implementation of automatic text display within the game. While I resorted to utilizing numerous timers in my code to address this issue, I am convinced that there exists a more streamlined approach that could have been employed. Additionally, I encountered difficulties in devising the mechanics for the player's inventory; however, through perseverance and experimentation, I ultimately devised a solution.
Reflecting on the narrative aspect of the project, I acknowledge that given more time, I could have enriched the storyline further, thereby enhancing the overall depth of the game. Nevertheless, there is a particular aspect of the game that resonates with me—the poignant moment where players have the opportunity to read a heartfelt letter from the owner, accompanied by evocative background music, creating a profoundly comforting atmosphere.
Despite the considerable time investment required for the creation of visual assets, I am exceedingly pleased with how it turns out. Moving forward, I recognize the need to strike a balance between my insistence on maintaining a particular aesthetic and the practical considerations of time management. Embracing a more flexible approach, especially when faced with constraints on time, will undoubtedly prove beneficial in future projects.

###**Debrief**
The project was overall satisfying. My theme for this project was “empathy,” while I was struggling to think about a story to tell, I thought about my two cats and decided to tell a story between pets and owners, the love without any condition. Since it is a narrative game, I decided to add more dialogue/texts than I used to have in a game, and it turned out to be appropriate. The challenging part was to make the text automatically display — I used a lot of timer in my code to realize this but I believe there should be an easier way to do this. The movements for the player were simple, I had a problem making the inventory but I eventually figured out a way. For the narrative part I think I could make the story more rich if I had more time. The part I like most about this game is where the player could read the letter from the owner and how that goes along with the background music was a very comforting scene.
For this project I spent a lot of time on drawing assets, but I really like how the overall vibe of the game turned out. I’m probably going to insist on this even though it took me a lot of time…I should try being more flexible on this if I am short on time.

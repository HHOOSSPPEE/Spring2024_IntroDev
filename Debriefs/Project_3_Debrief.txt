## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

In the process of creating an engaging and competitive experience, I ended up creating a two-player competitive multiplayer game inspired by Broforce. The essence of this game is with its unique challenge where players are pitted against each other with the goal of achieving the highest score through direct elimination. A distinctive mechanic sets this game apart: players are incapable of performing jumps in the conventional sense. Instead, an innovative teleportation feature is activated when a player approaches the edge of a platform, teleporting them upward onto the platform. There’s also a pipe that sucks the player up. This mechanic was born from the thematic concept of 'grounded.' I was interested in the idea of removing the ability to jump, a fundamental action in most 2D platform shooters that players heavily rely on for navigation and maneuvering, and replacing it with a mechanism that would automatically teleport players to the platform's surface upon close proximity.
This design decision to eliminate jumping and introduce platform teleportation rapidly became my favorite aspect of the game. It radically transforms the gameplay dynamics, as players are no longer able to evade projectiles through jumping as is common in other games. Instead, players are compelled to strategically maneuver either downward or upward across platforms with greater urgency. This restriction not only injects a thrilling element of challenge but also compels players to adapt their strategies, departing from their traditional comfort zones in gameplay. This element of excitement stems from the limitations imposed on players, forcing them to engage with the game in a manner that is both unfamiliar and challenging.
Throughout the development process, I discovered the invaluable resource of Gamemaker's tutorials, especially given that managing two players simultaneously was a new and initially daunting task. Questions such as managing code efficiently, crafting clean and effective code applicable to both player entities, and overcoming the challenge of dual-player dynamics were areas where Gamemaker’s tutorials offered essential guidance and insights.
Next time, I hope to enrich the game's environment by introducing interactive objects and incorporating multiple playable characters. Initially, the game featured a variety of characters, but the complexity of ensuring seamless interaction with environmental objects while maintaining clear player identification proved to be exceedingly challenging. Consequently, I made the difficult decision to remove these features. However, informed by this experience and the insights gained, I aim to revisit and successfully integrate these elements in future iterations, enhancing the game's depth and interactivity.


## **Self Evaluation**
**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5
I think my game sticks to the theme perfectly. The player can't jump in the game and forcing them to stay on the ground the whole time.

**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5

I think my game fits the scope pretty nicely, since it's a competitive multiplayer game, you can play indefinitely. The map has enough size and depth for numerous tactics.

**Overall** - Pass

I think my game definitely passes as it meets all of the provided requirements.

## **Debrief**
When I first conceived of this project, I had an idea of using a mouse movement to play a game similar to curling. I hope to make a game that is fun and not just about points, but it seems difficult to implement due to the gamemaker's tech reasons. And there is no way to make a game that can be played by two people at the same time with this idea. Then, I thought about sports games a lot, but they didn't seem to be the area of greatest interest to me. Occasionally, I thought of those reality shows with betrayal elements. The competetion elements and the consideration of the two people were very interesting. So I came up with a new idea, using the Prisoner's Dilemma to make a game.

I ended up doing a two-player open multi-turn prisoner's dilemma, (rather than the traditional closed option). I think the final product is a lot of fun, and I really like the ability to quickly switch between options, which opens up more possibilities for how to play. For example, two players have agreed to cooperate for one round and split the points equally. But one of the players actually wanted to keep the points for himself, so he switched options at the last second, giving him +500 points alone. The mechanic of being able to see another player's options I think creates more drama possibilities.

color is an interesting resource that has made a great contribution to the art of my game. It helped me choose a lot of low-saturation, more harmonious game colors, which I think is very useful.

I may also use a little more iterative development method in my next production. In this development, I adopted this method. This gives me a sense of direction, and I will quickly know what else I need to do, and what I can do to make the game more complete.
Drawing with Ipad makes my pictures more beautiful than drawing in Gamemaker, which I think is very important. I really like the setting of changing skins, which gives players more choices. In my game, I can use F1 and F2 to change skins. But in the next game development, I may make this feature more obvious, such as having an obvious link for players to choose skins before starting the game. I probably won't use the preset fonts in the next game I make because I find that, especially at large scales, they conflict with my art style.





## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 4

*I think it is majority good, could be better with sounds*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 3.5


*I think the scope  can be a little bit more bigger by adding more elements *


**Overall** - Pass


*I think it's good work! I like it at least*

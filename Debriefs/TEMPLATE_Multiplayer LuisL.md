## **Debrief**
I have mixed feelings on this project. I was able to make separate controllers for the different players and the UI functions decently. However, creating the illusion of an object coming from the background was a bit difficult. It’s not included just yet but I’m continuing to work on it. First, making objects that would not have a hit box and continue to scale for a short time proved difficult to get the timing down. Also, having them appear randomly from an array, I’m still figuring that out cause I’m not too familiar with working with arrays. Despite it missing the replacements of that mechanic is replaced by  orbs being shot and passed by the player. If the shift button is held the orbs move faster but the player earns more score. The fast movement of both the players and the obstacles to dodge, I think help to create the feeling of being too fast. The multiplayer aspect comes in trying to survive longer compared to the other player while also trying to get a higher score than them. At the end, the text displays which player is the winner and the game can be restarted by pressing both shift keys. The time and score for each player is displayed in each portion of their screen. I think being able to have a dedicated time in class helped with generating the idea but getting help to execute an idea seems a little difficult. With how many different projects and themes there are it would be difficult to have class time with a lecture to help everyone. It doesn’t help either that midterm week didn’t allow me to dedicate as much time as I would have liked. Nonetheless I’m alright with this initial prototype of the game and I hope to upload a more complete version before the game is reviewed so I can get feedback on how I would like the game to be commented on. In the future, I think reaching out for help will certainly be helpful. While I did ask for help during the lecture time the week before the project was due; and I did have an idea of what I wanted to do, I didn’t actually know how to go about coding it, even with review of the documentation and reference to other projects. 

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*The movement of the players and the time to avoid objects creates a sense of speed. There is multiplayer present and each player tries to outsurive the other*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 2


*I wasn't able to simulate the blocks coming from the background but I'm still continuing to work on it and I hope to have it uploaded before it's reviewed. The UI and movement is all included but the aspect of "avoiding" the background isn't there.*


**Overall** - Pass


*The game is delivered and still being worked on and has the criteria required*

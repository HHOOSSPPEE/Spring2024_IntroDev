## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

To briefly summarize what I've done in this game, I would like to describe it as a 2D pixel-based game that tells a small story revealing family issues. I used room transitions as a core mechanic in my game inspired by many games I've played before. In my perception about this game, there are many implications hided in the environment I created as the first room of the game and it acts as a hint to open up the conversation of this narrative game. The narrative aspect is what I liked for this project, especially when it is deeply connected with the theme we chose in class. I always wished to create a narrative game of my own during my study period in NYU, and opportunities like this project can help me get the direction of making actual indie games simpler. 
When I'm thinking of how to connect my theme "quiet" with the prerequisites of this project, I actually met a lot of obstacles. I spent a lot of time thinking of the main theme of the game and how to arrange the environment and the core game play. I first tried to use a visual novel style to create my story. However, as I started to code my project, the problems emerges repeatedly and the number farly exceeds my expectation. So after a bit of a struggle, I decided to abandon visual novel and make 2D gameboy style game and add conversations in it. And for this content, I changed to another story pivoted to the relationship bwtween a mother and a son, while the protagonist act as an audience. The exploration of the environment enables him and the player to experience the story. The theme of quiet are established in this game as the boy refused to communicate with her mom despite of more and more misunderstandings happened between them, and resulting in a catastrophe. However, since I didn't have a lot of time left after attempting and failing, I had to reduce the duration of the game and the story. So the whole thing seemed a little short.  
I utilized a Zelda style tile to create the main environment of my game. I love the color and the feeling of those assets. And I think using them creates a good mood for my game. Also, when I'm looking for inspirations for this project, some comments about narrative games caught my eye. People say that the core to make a touching story is not through a long and dull foreshadow, but through a clear structure and an intriguing climax. Although I could not utilize this advice a lot this time, I'm  sure I will take this the next time I make a narrative game. I still feel the large potential of making a 2D narrative game, but I think I will switch to make a visual novel next time to enlarge my range of techniques. 


## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution**  - 5

*I think it meets the theme quite well, although it may be a bit implicit.*


**Scope**  - 3


*I think it works but there are still a large range of space to improve.*


**Overall** - Pass

*Although this is a short game illustrating a short story, I still think it meets the most of the prerequisites and could be given a pass. *

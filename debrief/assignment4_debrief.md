## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

For this 4th assignment of inventory games, I tried to make a game of interacting with the inventory inside the game. However, things are not working really well during my process. For the first week, when I finished building up the concept of game and started making them, I figured out that I have a lot of missing knowledge of either how to build an inventory and how to interact with the inventory. I tried to learn it online but there has been a lot of void between my goal and the videos. Moreover, I'm sick for the first several days last week and I missed the inventory demo and I cannot really understand the usage of slots and stuffs so I decided to work on my own style. My first thoughts are making a completely immersed inventory system to construct the whole game that player can select and drag items like Resident Evil 4. However, when I finished my inventory codes, the bugs occurs far too frequently for me to cope with them.	I spend most of my time debugging and thinking of what to do in my coding process. So sadly in the end, I'm not able to figure out how to select and drag objects to certain spaces so I decided not doing it. So I end up making a small selector that player can select items and store them inside a bag. The only thing I enjoy in my game is the game feel. I created some feedback in the inventory box including a rectangle that will highlight when it is selected and a line of text that will fade to the top of the screen after pressing the left mouse button. This feedback system will make the game feel more professional in my perception. However, the bag system does not work as I perceived.
Considering a useful resource for me, I would like to mention some youtube videos and the Gamemaker manual. Only absorbing the demo code in the class cannot allow me to really understand how this "inventory system" works. So I first looked up the Gamemaker manual for hours to check the codes for inventory, and I found a dozens of them. Still  being confused, I opened up the YouTube to look for answers for how to use these codes properly. Although all the different videos have different ways of coding, I still take many benefits from understanding their principals. For next time, I will continue this way of learning new codes from these resources. And I will try to spend more time on all the projects as I gradually found out I'm not that good at coding and solving all the bugs. 


## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution**  - 5

*I base everything on the theme "point", everything are done by clicking, so this is met.*


**Scope** - 2


*The game does not have a good scope in my opinion. It cannot be considered as a game in actuality.*


**Overall** - Fail


*I don't think I did a good job in this assignment. The bugs are unfixable and the game does not meet all the requirements.*

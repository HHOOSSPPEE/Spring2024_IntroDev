## **Debrief**
For this project, I did a clone game level 1 for Kirby Dreamlands, this is a 2D platformer and the main difficulty is solving the continuous jumping for Kirby. The difference between Kirby and Mario and the other platformers is that Kirby can make multi-jumps. In this case, I tweaked some variables to make it different from ordinary jumps. Also, to make things special, I changed the number so that only in a time limit the Kirby can jump twice or further. If two jumps are separated, Kirby will fall. However, I do encountered some problems while making the enemies move and spawn over restarting the room as the game will stop building. I also encountered some camera problems that makes my camera code working sometimes but not everything. 
I would like to assess my project as a plain one with a lot of space to improve. Due to traditional activities I don’t have much time working on it outside of the class so I cannot work out every solutions for the problems. But I do like how the floating state work in my game, so it is an interesting experience making this clone. I would like to fix all the bugs in my code and add on more levels and huds and UIs if there is a chance to repeat or do again. And for comments and resources, I will need some comments on game feel and solutions for these bugs. Also, I know it’s impossible but perhaps I will need a clip on some common ways to solve these common bugs in game making process. 

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*Write your elaboration within the asterixis*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*Write your elaboration within the asterixis*


**Overall** - Pass/Fail


*Write your elaboration within the asterixis*

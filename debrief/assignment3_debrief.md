## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

The game I end up making is Octane. This is a 2D shooting game in which two players cooperate to accomplish the game. In my expectation, one player should controll the mouse and the other should controll the keyboard to succeed in this game. And in order to meet up with the theme of boost in this game, I intentionally make boost aspects such as the player can press shift to gain an increase in speed, the enemy bullets have hit back in the player and the player will have a small amount of acceleration when being hit. What I liked about these aspects is that I made sacrifices for the boost. When the speed is increase, the shooting function is disabled to avoid player abusing this ability. And what I liked about this game is the camera and mouse coordination aspect. In the game, the mouse directly controlls the direction of the gun and the bullets as well. And when the player is dragging the mouse, the gun will follow along with the camera. This allows the player to acquire more information towards the direction to shoot so eliminating enemies will be fairly simpler. 
This game originated from a prototype game from last semester, and I remade the map and rewrote many code through the knowledge I learnt this semester. The game feel became better through this process as well as the animation and UI are embedded. I also used "enum" function we just learnt last week to simplify my code in a small extent. I feel like everything I learnt this semester is helpful to me in this project. In this case, as a indie game fan, I will continue working on this type of 2D shooter and refine this until it looks like 20 Minutes Til Dawn or other games. However, I will change this game into a solo game as I think there are many flaws in my thought of making a co-op game. I will probably change the path and make it a battle game in which two players use keys to controll where they shoot and fight against each others. I think this type of cooperation lacks connections between the players now. By saying this, I mean that if only one player players this game, the game feel will be better. I found out this issue this week, however, after playing similar games, I didn't seem to figure out a solution other than completely changing the theme of the game. And since I didn't have more than 6 hours to work on this project this week, I decided not to tweak the multiplayer content a lot. Also, there are minor bugs such as I couldn't revive properly and the BGM will overlap with each other etc. The UI system did not work out really well too. I'm sure that I will put some time on this project in summer break and refine it. 
In the end, I think this experience making a multiplayer game is quite unique as I spent a lot of time testing and failing to find out the direction. I wished I have more time but I still think I did a fairly good job to make a rough prototype into a playable small shooter. And I wish to learn the way to controll the difficulty of the game in future classes. 


## **Self Evaluation**


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*Yes it does. I gave it the theme of boost and there are elements of boost in the game*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4


*I feel like the game is quite well but it still lacks some polish in the multiplayer content*


**Overall** - Pass

*I think the game looks good and the theme is met so it should be a pass.*

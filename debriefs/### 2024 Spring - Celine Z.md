## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

	For this assignment, I made a game revolving around the theme of resurfacing with multiplayer elements, so I included aquatic themes to help me achieve the intended effects. The idea behind this project was to create a story between two individuals that are made rivals due to chance and situations even if there is an underlying spark between them. Hence the features in the game where in the first room, if the two characters ever come in contact with each other, the game restarts, representing the fates that solemnly keep them apart. Additionally, with the two mermaids have their own tally of scores, or the amount of starfish that they collecting, aiming to create a sense of rivalry and competition, giving a false sense of needing to one up each other, to be the one that escapes the ocean, and able to resurface back to the surface. But in reality, none of that matters, as long as they both manage to capture a certain number of starfish to both be able to resurface. But if this requirement is not reached, then they both drown no matter who the ‘victor’ is. So, the player has to figure out how to escape the sea based on clues of what not to do, and hopefully be able to connect the dots to how to achieve both endings. Generally, I enjoyed making the transitions and the designing process of this project. I had a bunch of ideas of what to do, where to go, but I had to be realistic about what I’m capable of making, and work roundabouts to execute my ideas in a simpler and accessible manner. I wished I had more time to add more features into this project, because I felt that there was still room for improvement and building onto the base. But I unfortunately spent too much time debugging the code. Like the last project, I used a lot of online resources, forums, and youtube tutorials to help me with this project, in addition to requesting help from my classmates. But I do think I’ve become slightly more familiar with code compared to last week, due to the amount of time I spent rewriting and understanding each singular line of code to debug a mistake that completely halted my progress of the project. (It was honestly such a simple mistake as well but I spent over 2 hours trying to figure out what went wrong.) But I’ll definitely be using some of the techniques I used for this week's code for next week, but I might do some additional research about next week's assignment, since it’s been a while since I’ve done inventory and I didn’t grasp the idea when I was introduced to it last semester.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 4

*Well, I definitely made my project for the sake of the theme, but I felt like I could’ve added more to it if I had more coding experience.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 3.5


*I felt like there would have definitely been more aspects of this game to be fleshed out, but I just didn’t have the time and strategy to add it to the game without running into bugs or unusable code.*


**Overall** - Pass


*I think I had all of the basic components of the assignments, though as always I feel like I could’ve added more to the game.*

## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.
I ended up making an abstract styled narrative game, where the story is more or less implied rather than spoken out loud. The original idea behind it was to create a horror/thriller-esque game where the player is able to feel and experience the game throughout its visuals and musicality. The protagonist is stuck in this dimension where they’re forced to kill monsters representing their fear in this forest, while stuck in a loop. As they reached the switch to ascend out of the hellhole, they found themself in a simulation loop that they’ll never escape from, representing trauma and the feeling of reliving through the same fear day after day, after day, as there is no ‘end’ to this game. When transported to the screen with text, either option will teleport the protagonist back to the beginning, back to the forest to re-kill the enemies, forever. Additionally, the theme word for this particular project was ‘beat’, which appeared in the way that the protagonist eliminates the enemies, with their fists. There are ups and downs in this project, which can’t be helped in the case of game making in general. I had a complex artistic vision for the aesthetics of the game, but rather it’s quite difficult to create it to perfection, and the perspective that the game is played in didn’t quite match my expectations. But I did enjoy how the music chosen added onto the ambiance and the eeriness of the game. I liked the process of the game making process, especially adding the elements and watching the game come together, even if it’s not perfect to my standards. I found a lot of online resources giving tips on how to add the sounds and music where it’ll compliment the game, feel more smoother and provide a better experience. I did get some help from the coding desk for help for the timers and I’ll definitely be using them more to help implement more complex elements into the game. I’ll also probably draft the game out on paper to jot down my ideas like how I did for this game, as it helps me gather my thoughts and figure out what elements and assets I want to use for the game. Rather differently, I would like to look into premade assets next time, as I’ve looked around at some games and those assets looked really clean and neatly made compared to my freehanded sprites. 
 
## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 3

*It was kind of difficult for me to really add too much of the theme, 'beat' into the game. Though I had ideas, they all seemed too mechanically challenging for my skill level to attempt unfortunately, so I instead used the theme in more of an artistic interpretation way to incorporate it into the game.*
 


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 3


*I wanted to add some more elements at the end of the game, in the second screen, but I had technical difficulties and couldn't complete my vision. I just feel like I had so much ambition for these games but I get stumped when it comes to applying it to code and actually making it.*


**Overall** - Pass


*I'm pretty sure I met the requirements of the theme, artistic elements, and the 2 music soundtracks controlled by code.*

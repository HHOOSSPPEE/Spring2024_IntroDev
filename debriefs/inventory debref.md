## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

	For this assignment, I made a simple game revolving around the inventory, so I mostly focused my code on creating the inventory and a smooth interface for item collection and inventory display. I used arrays to create the actual inventory system, while using functions to create a list of items, so I can simplify and manage all of the items and behaviors in one place. My theme for this assignment was heavy, which I transcribed as doing heavy labor work like farming, crop collecting, etc, which was heavily influenced by Stardew Valley. The player can run around the farm, collect produce items from trees and crops, in addition to collecting eggs and milk from the animals. As for the inventory system, it’s displayed on the left hand side of the screen, showing the sprite of the item collected and the name of said item. The player can hover their mouse over the name of the item, and it should turn yellow, signifying that it’s being selected, and it will also show a small description of the item. The player can also right click on the item in the inventory to dispose of it. There is a limit of 15 inventory spaces, so after that limit is reached, the player may no longer pick up any items unless they delete some from their inventory. I’m quite satisfied with how the inventory is structured, where I can add more variety of items into my game without changing much code at all, so it’s quite flexible for any future developments. I also think the game runs quite smoothly with no bugs (I think), and generally the smooth functionality of this game. I used a variety of resources for this game, mainly YouTube tutorials, reddit posts, and the code from class, and using all of them to understand the basis of inventory and how to formulate the code. I did struggle quite a bit in understanding functions and arrays, especially because I’ve never used functions in my code before and it’s still a new concept for me, and I’ve always disliked arrays so I also don’t have much experience implementing arrays in my code either. So overall this project was quite the struggle for me, since I’m still grasping the foundations of arrays and functions, which are important coding components that really expands the possibilities of elements that I can implement into games in the future. As for future projects, I’ll probably use the code from this project as reference for future arrays, inventories, and function usages. 

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 3

*This theme was definitely hard to do, but I think it somewhat justified my ending gameplay.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4


*There’s always more to add to these games as they’re quite simple and not quite complete, but I think I have the basics down, especially for the inventory system*


**Overall** - Pass


*I was able to fulfill all the requirements for this assignment, and though I think my theme was a bit iffy, I did have the inventory system pretty fleshed out.*

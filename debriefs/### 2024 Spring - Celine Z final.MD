## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

For the final project, I built upon the narrative aspect of my narrative project. I made many changes and additions to both the narrative and coding side of the game. I added an inventory function, for collecting items. A dialogue function that functions in a separate room. Which included textboxes, arrays for dialogs, and being able to create different endings. In addition to a button in the dialog room that you can press to return back to the main room. There are 3 endings that you can get, which all depends on how much exp the player collects from killing skeletons. I also added different animating sprites for player walking, left, right, up, and down, along with an attacking/weapon swing animation as well. I liked that I was able to use a lot of the new skills that I’ve learned this semester in this project, and just overall an improvement of my skills compared to my previous project. I used a lot of online resources, tutorials, forums, my previous codes, and the demo codes that we went over in class to help me with the coding aspect of this project. Though I implemented a lot of new features that I just learned recently, there are some stuff that I couldn’t add because of how complex the code was already and I wasn’t familiar enough to add codes for, like example, sequences, enums, and the A.I. function for enemies. But I ran into a lot of bugs, where the sprite wouldn’t display properly, or the code wouldn’t run, and small things that made implementing them extremely frustrating until I gave up and deleted it. I might try them in smaller projects in the future before adding them onto a bigger project. But I would love to add those features as they would add a lot more layers to my game. A piece of critique that I definitely took into consideration is the amount of interactivity objects in my world, which I added an npc with dialog, monsters that can be killed along with gaining exp, collecting items with an inventory system, and a switch that the player can find and access their endings. The advice that I didn’t quite incorporate was the world size, I originally had a bigger world, but after finishing most of the coding, I felt that the world was a bit too big, and I ended up shrinking the size of the world a lot so it’d seem less empty. 

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

4, overall I think the project did stay in the general vicinity of the direction that I was going for. 


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


3, I felt like I overestimated my skills, especially when coding the enemies. I went over the code with Irene in class, and I thought that it would run smoothly, but it ended up not working, maybe because it was not compatible with the codes already existing in my game. So I felt I had a lot more planned, but a lot of the coding aspects fell through at the end. 


**Overall** - Pass/Fail


Pass, I feel like I definitely polished the game up a lot more, the code is less jumbled and redundant, and I added more functions to the game than before.
